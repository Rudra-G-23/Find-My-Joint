I want to create an python library that can help me to find the joint between across many datasets so I think to create an python package which contains few things 

- only one line functions which helps me the find the joint and make a data frame so we can manuplate 
- one network graph that give me the interactive network graph  when we provide this dataset it give me the all the a beatiful graph of the relationship 

you provide me structure the my python packge with this two main functionalitys  and 
give me the all requemient need for this and think long give me a proper plan for this 


```pythn
# dataset sources 
ds1 = 
ds2 = 
.....

FindMyJoint(
datasets = [ds1, ds2, ds3],
columns = ["column_1", ""column_2", ""column_3"],
include =
exclude 
include_dtype =
exclude_dtype = 
)

```



def FindMyJoint(datasets, columns, include=None, exclude=None, include_dtype=None, exclude_dtype=None):
    """
    Function to find potential joins from multiple datasets based on specified columns, inclusion, and exclusion rules.
    
    Args:
    - datasets (list of pd.DataFrame): List of datasets (DataFrames) to join.
    - columns (list of str): Columns to join on (must be in all datasets).
    - include (list of str, optional): Columns to include in the join.
    - exclude (list of str, optional): Columns to exclude from the join.
    - include_dtype (list of str, optional): Data types to include for joinable columns (e.g., 'int64', 'float64').
    - exclude_dtype (list of str, optional): Data types to exclude from joinable columns.

    Returns:
    - pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame resulting from the join of all datasets.
    """
